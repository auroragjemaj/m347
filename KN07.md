- Unterschied zwischen Pods und Replicas

In Kubernetes, pods are the smallest runnable units, containing one or more containers. Replicas ensure that a specified number of identical pods run simultaneously
to maintain the availability and scalability of an application--> pods represent instances of an application, while replicas ensure enough pods are running 
to keep the application operational.


- Unterschied zwischen Service und Deployment

A Service in Kubernetes is like a specific address for a bunch of pods. It helps different parts of the application talk to these pods without knowing exactly where they are. 
It also spreads out the traffic to these pods evenly.

A Deployment tells Kubernetes how to create and update pods. It lets you change the application while it's still running. For instance, you can add new pods or swap out old ones 
without stopping the application for users.


- Welches Problem löst Ingress?

In Kubernetes, Ingress works as a gate for external traffic into the cluster. It takes requests from outside and sends them to the right services inside, following set rules.
Without Ingress, each service would need its own public IP and port, which would be messy.



- Für was ist ein statefulset?

In Kubernetes, a StatefulSet helps handle applications that need to remember specific things, like who's logged in or other data that sticks around. 
Unlike apps that can be easily copied, these apps need to store data that stays put. For example, a StatefulSet could be used for a messaging system to make sure messages don't get lost.
