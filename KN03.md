Explaining: In the default bridge, they're connected with the Ip-Adress that can change with the time, that's why you can't use the name of the container to ping them.
When you create a network and use that, you can use the name because it won't change with the time.
(you can use the Ip-Adress for both)


Betrachten Sie nun KN02.
In welchem Netzwerk befanden sich die beiden Container?
Wieso konnten die miteinander reden?

In KN02 the containers were in the same gateway and they couldn't communicate with the container name. With the "Link" they could communicate, 
because the Ip-Adresse was connected with the name.
